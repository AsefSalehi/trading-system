### Ticket: BACKEND-001 - API-Driven Cryptocurrency Listing Service

**Task**  
Develop a RESTful API for cryptocurrency listing and analysis, providing real-time and historical data integration.

**Requirements**  
- Implement FastAPI with versioned endpoints.  
- Fetch, normalize, and store cryptocurrency data from publicly available sources.  
- Support querying based on symbols, market cap, and trading volume.  
- Store all structured data in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy 2.x ORM.  
- Enforce rate limiting and caching with Redis.  
- All responses must follow a documented schema (OpenAPI spec).  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- API endpoints return consistent and validated JSON responses.  
- Cryptocurrency listings update at predefined intervals using Celery or Temporal.  
- Data is cached for performance optimization.  
- OpenAPI schema is automatically generated and accessible at `/docs`.  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Unit tests for data fetching, validation, and persistence.  
- Integration tests for API endpoints.  
- Load testing to ensure performance under heavy queries.

### Ticket: BACKEND-002 - Risk Assessment Engine

**Task**  
Implement risk assessment algorithms to evaluate the volatility and potential risk of cryptocurrencies.

**Requirements**  
- Utilize scientifically validated statistical and econometric models.  
- Integrate data from market indicators, historical volatility, and news sentiment.  
- Store computed risk scores in PostgreSQL.  
- Ensure results are reproducible and explainable.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Risk scores are generated per asset and updated daily.  
- Risk scores must include metadata: calculation timestamp, model version, and confidence interval.  
- All algorithms must be configurable and modular.  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Unit tests for risk algorithms with mock datasets.  
- Cross-validation with historical backtests.  
- Verification of reproducibility across environments.

### Ticket: BACKEND-003 - Role-Based Authentication & Permissions

**Task**  
Implement authentication and permissions using role-based access control (RBAC).  

**Requirements**  
- Authentication with JWT tokens.  
- Role-based authorization checks on every protected endpoint.  
- Secure password hashing and user management.  
- Tokens must expire and support refresh mechanisms.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Users can only access resources permitted by their assigned roles.  
- Unauthorized requests return proper HTTP error codes.  
- Security best practices are applied (OWASP compliance).  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Unit tests for login, logout, and token refresh.  
- Integration tests for permission-restricted endpoints.  
- Security testing for token forgery and replay attacks.

### Ticket: BACKEND-004 - Task & Workflow Management

**Task**  
Implement background job execution and workflow orchestration.  

**Requirements**  
- Use Celery or Temporal for job scheduling and execution.  
- Jobs include: data fetching, risk recalculation, cleanup tasks.  
- Store job status and results in PostgreSQL.  
- Support retry logic and failure alerts.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- All background tasks run reliably and recover from failures.  
- Monitoring of job queue is available through metrics.  
- Failed jobs trigger alerts.  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Unit tests for task scheduling.  
- Integration tests for long-running workflows.  
- Stress tests for concurrency.

### Ticket: BACKEND-005 - Logging & Monitoring

**Task**  
Implement centralized logging, monitoring, and reporting.  

**Requirements**  
- Structured JSON logging with request correlation IDs.  
- Logging must cover authentication, API calls, and background jobs.  
- Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection.  
- Grafana dashboards for visualization.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Logs are queryable and structured in JSON.  
- Prometheus scrapes metrics for API, tasks, and database.  
- Grafana dashboards provide insights into performance and errors.  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Verification of log format and structure.  
- Monitoring tests with simulated failures.  
- Validation of alerting rules in Prometheus.

### Ticket: BACKEND-006 - Risk Management Tools

**Task**  
Develop tools that assist users in minimizing losses and maximizing returns based on computed risk profiles.  

**Requirements**  
- Provide portfolio-level risk aggregation.  
- Generate automated risk alerts based on thresholds.  
- Store user-specific recommendations in PostgreSQL.  
- Ensure explanations and data references are included.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Users receive actionable risk insights.  
- Portfolio metrics update in real-time with new data.  
- Risk alerts are logged and visible in reports.  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Unit tests for portfolio risk calculations.  
- Backtest portfolio risk aggregation.  
- Validate alerting system under simulated conditions.

### Ticket: BACKEND-007 - Reporting & Moderation

**Task**  
Develop backend services for reporting and moderation of system activities.  

**Requirements**  
- Generate periodic reports on cryptocurrency performance, risks, and alerts.  
- Provide administrative endpoints for reviewing anomalies.  
- Ensure reports are exportable in JSON and CSV formats.  
- Store moderation actions in PostgreSQL with full audit trails.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Reports are accurate, timestamped, and traceable.  
- Admin users can view, filter, and flag anomalies.  
- Moderation logs are immutable.  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Unit tests for report generation.  
- Integration tests for admin endpoints.  
- Verification of audit trail immutability.
