**Requirements**  
- Use Chart.js or Recharts for data visualization.  
- Display historical and real-time metrics (price, market cap, volume).  
- Implement interactive time filters (1d, 7d, 30d, 90d).  
- Ensure full responsiveness on desktop and mobile.  
- Use React Query for API integration and caching.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Dashboard displays charts with accurate data from backend APIs.

**Task**  
Build a risk reporting dashboard for asset-level and portfolio-level insights.  

**Requirements**  
- Display individual cryptocurrency risk scores with metadata.  
- Show aggregated portfolio-level risk metrics.  
- Enable filtering and sorting by risk level, timestamp, and asset.  
- Provide real-time alerts for new or updated risks.  

**Acceptance Criteria**

**Requirements**  
- Display live trade activities with anomaly detection indicators.  
- Provide moderation tools for flagging and reviewing trades.  
- Support exporting reports in CSV format.  
- Integrate real-time updates for live monitoring.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Dashboard shows accurate trade data streams.  
- Moderation actions (flag, filter) update UI instantly.  
- Exported CSV reports include timestamped and accurate data.  

**Testing Requirements**  
- Unit tests for moderation components.  
- Integration tests for live update handling.

Implement a real-time notification system across the application.  

**Requirements**  
- Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates.  
- Display notifications in a dedicated UI panel.  
- Categorize notifications by type (alerts, updates, system).  
- Allow dismissing and marking notifications as read.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- Notifications arrive in real-time without refresh.  
- Notifications are grouped by category and persist in client state.  
- Users can manage notifications (dismiss, mark read).  

**Testing Requirements**
